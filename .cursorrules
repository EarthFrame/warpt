# Cursor AI Rules for warpt

## Communication Style
- Keep code and documentation clean, clear, and concise
- Focus on clarity; if something clever is needed, explain it clearly
- Summarize work directly in chat, not in separate summary files
- Don't create post-task summary documents (no `*_SUMMARY.md` files)

## Documentation
- Only create documentation files (*.md) when explicitly requested
- Don't proactively create README files unless asked
- Keep documentation in existing docs/ directory when needed
- Prefer inline docstrings and comments over separate docs

## Code Style
- Follow existing project patterns and conventions
- Use type hints throughout
- Use `X | None` instead of `Optional[X]` for type annotations
- Keep lines under 88 characters (black/ruff defaults)
- No blank lines with whitespace
- Comprehensive docstrings with Args/Returns sections

## Project Structure
- Models go in `warpt/models/`
- Backend implementations go in `warpt/backends/`
- CLI commands go in `warpt/commands/`
- Use Pydantic models for structured data
- Integrate with existing models when possible

## Testing and Examples
- Examples go in `examples/` directory
- Write clear, runnable examples
- Include tests when appropriate
- Verify linting passes before finishing

## What NOT to Do
- ❌ Don't create task summary files after completing work
- ❌ Don't create unsolicited documentation files
- ❌ Don't use echo or command-line tools for communication
- ❌ Don't use Optional[] (use `X | None` instead)
- ❌ Don't create helper scripts unless necessary

## Summary Format
When summarizing completed work, do it in the chat using this format:

```
## Completed: [Task Name]

### What Was Created/Modified
- file1.py - Brief description
- file2.py - Brief description

### Key Features
- Feature 1
- Feature 2

### Usage Example
[Brief code example]

### Try It
[Command to run/test]
```

Keep it concise and conversational, not formal documentation.
