"""Constants for warpt models and commands.

This module contains constant values used across warpt models for:
- Component targets (cpu, gpu, memory, etc.)
- Test status values (pass, fail, warning, etc.)
- Hardware type identifiers
- Validation constraints and limits

Constants are organized into classes for better namespacing and discoverability.
